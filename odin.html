      <h1>The Odin Project</h1>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank"><p>
  <b>The Odin Project (TOP)</b></a> was founded in 2013 by <a href="https://eriktrautman.com/about" target="_blank"><b>Erik Trautman</b></a>, a former hedge fund trader who transitioned into the tech world. After experiencing firsthand how inaccessible many coding resources were, he wanted to create a <strong>free and open-source alternative</strong> to the expensive bootcamps that were gaining popularity at the time. His goal was to give anyone, regardless of financial background, a clear and structured path to becoming a web developer. The name “Odin” was chosen after the Norse god of wisdom, symbolizing knowledge and guidance.
</p>

<p>
  In its early days, the Odin Project focused primarily on <strong>Ruby and Ruby on Rails</strong>, which were very popular web development tools at the time. Over the years, as JavaScript rose to dominance in web development, the curriculum evolved and a <strong>Full-Stack JavaScript path</strong> was introduced. This eventually became the main track most learners follow today, though the Ruby on Rails path still exists as an alternative.
</p>

<p>
  By 2017, Erik Trautman had shifted his attention to running <em>Viking Code School</em>, another coding education venture, but the Odin Project continued to grow through the efforts of its <strong>community of volunteers and contributors</strong>. In 2021, it officially became part of <strong>Thinkful (a coding bootcamp owned by Chegg)</strong>, ensuring long-term support while still remaining <strong>free, open-source, and community-driven</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Today, the Odin Project has a very active <strong>Discord community</strong> where learners support each other, collaborate on projects, and practice working in teams. It has helped <strong>hundreds of thousands of people worldwide</strong> learn programming, build portfolios, and break into tech careers. What began as one developer’s vision has grown into one of the most respected free resources for aspiring web developers.
</p>


      <h2>TOP Curriculum</h2>
      <p>
  The <strong>Odin Project curriculum</strong> is designed to take someone from little or no programming knowledge to being capable of building full-stack web applications. It begins with the <strong>Foundations course</strong>, which introduces the basics of web development. In this stage, learners get comfortable with essential tools such as HTML, CSS, Git, GitHub, and the command line, while also learning the fundamentals of JavaScript. The purpose of this first section is to build a solid base that prepares learners for the more advanced topics to come.
</p>

<p>
  After Foundations, students move into the <strong>Full-Stack JavaScript path</strong>, which is the main track today. Here, they revisit HTML and CSS in more depth, learning about responsive design, accessibility, and modern styling practices. The JavaScript section dives much deeper into the language, covering functions, objects, DOM manipulation, and modern ES6+ features. This leads into <strong>React</strong>, where students learn to build dynamic front-end applications with components, hooks, and state management. On the back-end side, the course covers <strong>Node.js and Express</strong>, teaching students how to build servers, create REST APIs, and handle authentication. Learners also explore <strong>databases</strong>, both SQL and MongoDB, to understand how data is stored and queried in web applications. Throughout this track, students build increasingly complex projects that tie together all these skills.
</p>

<p>
  An <strong>alternative path</strong> is also available for those interested in Ruby, which focuses on <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> as the back-end framework. While similar in structure, this path takes a different approach to server-side development, giving learners exposure to another ecosystem still used in many companies today.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, the curriculum also includes additional topics that prepare learners for real-world work. These cover <strong>deployment</strong> (using platforms like GitHub Pages, Heroku, or Render), <strong>testing</strong> (unit and integration testing), and career preparation, such as building portfolios, writing resumes, and preparing for job interviews. By the end, learners not only understand web development but also have <strong>portfolio-ready projects</strong> and practical experience collaborating with others, making them ready for junior developer roles.
